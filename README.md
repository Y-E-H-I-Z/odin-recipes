odin-recipes

## Description  
A simple recipe webpage built using semantic HTML.  
This project displays a delicious dish with its description, ingredients, and step-by-step instructions.  
Its purpose is to practise writing clean, semantic HTML code and organizing web content effectively, while reinforcing elements like headings, lists, images and paragraphs for accessibility and readability.

## Built With  
- HTML (semantic elements: header, section, article, figure, figcaption, etc)  
- CSS for styling the page  

## Features  
- Semantic HTML structure for improved readability and accessibility  
- Clear organization of ingredients and cooking steps via lists  
- Images with proper alt text to enhance usability  
- Simple and maintainable code suitable for beginners and for demonstration  

## Getting Started
